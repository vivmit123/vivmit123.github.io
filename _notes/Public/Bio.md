I’m a writer, attorney, and dad. I attended [Voices of our Nation](https://www.vonavoices.org/) (VONA) in 2020 where I was mentored by the amazing [Tananarive Due](https://www.tananarivedue.com/). I am a proud [Codexian](https://www.codexwriters.com/). I have had the fortune of sharing space with [Neelanjana Banerjee](https://www.neelanjanabanerjee.com/), [D’Lo](https://www.dlocokid.com/), and [Sehba Sarwar](https://sehbasarwar.com/) in writing workshops and other generative sites.

Much of my [writing](https://vivekmittal.com/index.php/writing/) is speculative, though not all. My work has appeared in Stupefying Stories, a STEAM multi-issue zine collaboration with [NExSci](https://nexsci.caltech.edu/), in _The Aerogram_, and in the _Asian Pacific American Law Journal_. 

As an attorney, I help lead the [UC Immigrant Legal Services Center](https://ucimm.law.ucdavis.edu/), a groundbreaking organization that provides free immigration legal services to University of California students and their family members. Prior to this, I clerked for a federal judge and worked at [NILC](HTTPS://NILC.org) engaging in impact litigation.

I recently started a newsletter exploring masculinity and vulnerability. Subscribe [here](http://vivmit.substack.com).

When not writing or working, I explore the wonders of the world with my partner and two kids.
